Python code related to Spring 2021 Modern Physics final

## Introduction
Hello and welcome, everyone (especially fellow PPC-ers). the Spring of 2021, I wrote a paper comparing principles from chaos theory with Jungian psychodynamics. I created several Python-based visuals based on open source libraries and hints from similar projects around the interwebz, which I will credit when possible in this material. In some sense, this is an index of existing online materials, though I've configured the code snippets a bit to match the purposes in my paper. 

This Github repository contains the code I used and instructions to help you run it locally if you're interested. You can read the **[paper here](https://github.com/bashmonet/chaos-visuals/blob/main/ben_thomas_PARP675601-2020-20-Final.pdf)**, though note that in PDF form, the animated visual (Figure 7) won't work.
